## UX
I design a grey “feel” back ground to contrast the colourful images and map. Text will be black. This webpage will be use by children, therefore there is no need to fill any registration form, no need to input any name & address details. The places are the most popular attraction in Singapore and all children love to visit. They can go there to enjoy the natural environment like Zoo or Birdpark, etc. The Red marker shown the actual location point and the Black marker show where are the nearby food location when they feel hungry.  

## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Java
4. Google map


3. Bootstrap (v4.3.1)

## Features
3 frames divided (top, left and right frames). Top: title, Left frame: Attraction pictures, Right : google map (Red marker= actual location when select and click on of the left pricture. Black marker show food nearby the attraction. There will a contact number to follow up with the in charge on the top centre. This webpage only English version.


## Features Left to Implement 
Game would be good to implement onto it to interest more children to glance the attraction info list. The game will gain points for voucher to exchange food and drinks.
